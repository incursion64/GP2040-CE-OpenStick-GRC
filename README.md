# GP2040-CE OpenStick by Game Room Customs (gameroomcustoms.com) 
 Custom Arcade Fight Stick

 The goal here was to design something heavyweight and durable but also offer something that was modular and easy to build and looks nice.

Included in this repository are all necessary files to process the material.
 - 2D DXF Files for laser cut metal & plastic cover
 - STL files for 3D printed Corners and spacer
 - PDF dimensionalized Prints
 - Bill of Materials for what i used

Graphic Template has not been included as you need only import the 2D DXF to Adobe illustrator or preferred program to process your artwork. 
If you decide to go with a snap in type button, be mindful that you can work with the approx 3-4mm thickness. I was able to get Sanwa genuine and clones in there. For the
clone types i had to make sure clips/anchors pushed out all the way so the button is secure. 1/16 or 1.6mm clear acrylic is recommended when usinf geniune sanwa buttons. 

Also note that i use a stick spacer.  This is not necessary if you want your stick to sit higher, but i added a 6mm (1/4") thick spacer to set the height where i like it. You could always add stick extensions as well. 

At a later date i will offer the build components or pre-built kits on my shop if anyone is interested.
